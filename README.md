*Hi, in Build directory you can find the MakeFile, use "make" in the terminal to compile a executable you can run, once you have the RunProgram exe and run it, it will ask you for a program name to run, i.e. "program1.txt".

*The 5 instructions we considered are: SET, LDR, STR, ADD, SHOW

*Every program ends with a SHOW instruction so you will see a message that shows the value allocated in the corresponding memory address.

*The code is not robust so it may fail at any unconsidered input. At the moment, it only has "program1.txt","program2.txt" or "program3.txt" to run.
